## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
	Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. And it contains many sub-projects. In this file, I will exaborate on nbviewer, which is a simple way to share Jupyter Notebooks. NBViewer can render Jupyter Notebooks as static web pages.
