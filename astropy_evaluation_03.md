## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	
	The project is 95.6% Python, 4.4% C and then a handful of other stuff thats irrelevant. 

2. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
	All that is needed is Python but having conda installed is recommended. 

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	
	There is an instructions page, it's super easy if you already have Anaconda installed and takes a whole 30 seconds after copying and pasting one command. If not, it takes about 5 minutes to get Anaconda installed. 

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	They require the following or a newer version: Python 3.6, numpy 1.16.0, and pytest 3.1. 

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	Everything I've looked at seems pretty organized and readable, its just python and they appear to follow standardized formatting. 

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	It's huge theres 151000 lines of code according to OpenHub. 

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	Contributors are not required to write their own tests but there is a repo in the github repo for testing. 



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	Yes the documentation is pretty solid. 

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	There website has a whole documentation page about the design of the project.

	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

	Issues appear to stay open for an average of 1-2 days.
