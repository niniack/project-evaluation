## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
   MIT License


## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

   Atom's autocomplete-plus package is written primarily in Javascript with a small percentage of the code being written in CSS.

1. What is the development environment? <br>

   The autocomplete-plus package is bundled with Atom. In order to enter the development environment one simply needs to execute "atom --dev" from the command line.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

   There is a link in the README.md file which redirects to sections of Atom's flight manual which gives very clear and concise instructions on how to build and install.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

   Yes the autocomplete-plus package has dependencies. Dependencies are installed by cloning the repository of package one wants to develop and executing "apm install" in the directory of the project. These instructions were easily found in Atom's Flight Manual.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

   The code is straightforward when you take the time read through the code but it is poorly documented and hard to understand when skimming through.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

   Atom is an extremely large project with over 500K lines of code. The autocomplete-plus repository is a small sub-section of this project with significantly less lines of code (~5K lines of code).

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

   The repository does not have any tests but in the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file it clearly states that all new code require tests to ensure against regression.



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

   The code is poorly documented. It is difficult to understand the purpose of many functions and variables.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
   No.

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

    There have been a grad total of zero (0) commits in the past week.

1. How many issues are currently open? <br>

   There are currently 147 open issues.

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>

   Issues are typically closed within two weeks but in some instance an issue can stay open for months.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

   There is some discussion with a few issues having 25+ comments.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

   Most issues are tagged but there are few that have any indication that they are suitable for beginners or first-time contributors.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

   Three (3) issues.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

   The repository states that there are 70 contributors but from the level of activity in that past year, it is safe to say that there isn't anyone actively maintaining this project.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

   The project hasn't had any contributors in the last six months.

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

   There are six (6) open pull requests.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>

   For the pull requests that were merged, they usually only remain open for a day or two. The other pull requests however can stay open for months or even years.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

   The isn't much discussion on the open pull requests but for the closed pull requests members of the community are actively engaged with some pull requests having over 100 comments.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

   Four (4) pull requests.



1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

   June 14, 2019

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

   The CONTRIBUTING file in the autocomplete-plus repository contains a link which redirects to the CONTRIBUTING file of the main Atom repository. This document is very thorough as it covers the types contributions that can be made, how to make them, and even a style guide for coding in the different languages.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

   There is a CODE OF CONDUCT document which outlines acceptable behaviour within the community and behaviours which will not be tolerated. The consequences for not adhering to code of conduct however are very vague and not very reassuring.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

   The maintainers are not very helpful in my opinion. They typically respond by saying that the issue has been noted and is being passed onto the engineers with no further iformation provided.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

   They are very strict with the way that an issue is reported and will complain if a report does not follow the expected format which is fair, but sometimes the language used can be a bit hostile.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>

   No, not from what I have observed.


## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

   I was very uninvolved in the process. I executed a few commands on the command-line and rest  took care of itself.

1. how long it take you? <br>

   The process took me about 5 minutes.

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

   Yes

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>

   Yes, the instructions were very straightforward

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>

   No
1. any other comments? <br>




## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>

   I don't believe it is possible to contribute to this project for a few reasons. The maintainers have repeatedly stated that they are not interested in implementing any new functionality. The issues that are currently open are not very beginner friendly and for those that are more experienced and can handle the more complex issues, may not see it as a valuable use of time as the maintainers are very peculiar about what contributions they want as demonstrated by the fact that the last commit was in June 2019 but several pull request have been made in the months since then>

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>

   I was initially interested in this project but after observing the rigidity of the maintainers and their inconsistency in responding, I have changed my mind.
