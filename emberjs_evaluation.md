## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
This project has a vibrant and welcoming community that encourages questions. It is well organized and provides sufficient documentation to guide new contributors. It offers both users of the product and contributors with many mediums to discuss issues, questions, and feature requests. The drawbacks to contributing to this project in the course of a semester are, (1) there are not enough opened issues for beginners, (2) issues are resolved *too* quickly, (3) the frequency of accepted pull requests is low. Due to these reasons, finding contributions to make to the project may prove to be difficult. Therefore, I would not reccommend contributing to this project, without providing some warning about these drawbacks. If you are willing to look past these challenges, then the welcoming community is definetly one that appears to be supportive to new contributors.


1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
I would be interested in contributing to this project because the community appears to be receptive to both new members and questions. It would be easier to navigate challenges that I might encounter with a supportive and present community to fallback on. Researching specific issues to tackle however, may prove to be difficult, but the community is welcoming enough to motivate me to try.
