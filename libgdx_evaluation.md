## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>

	Primarily Java at 38.4%, but C++ is at 31.3% so it's close.

2. What is the development environment? <br>

	Since libGDX projects are built and managed with the Gradle build tool 
	one can develop in "almost any environment." The project namedrops the 3 major Java IDEs: Intellij IDEA/Android Studio, Eclipse, and Netbeans, but highly recommends the Intellij IDE.
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	There are instructions linked right on the README! The instructions seem pretty easy to follow.

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	No, everything seems to be packaged into libGDX.

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	The source code file I looked at does make use of one of libGDX's own packages to a rather large extent, so to completely understand how the code accomplishes some things you'd have to delve into the code in the packages. However, it's not too difficult to understand (clear function names and variable names help).

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	The project has around 821,000 lines of code (as of 1 month ago according to OpenHub).

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	The repository has a tests folder. Contributors are not expected to write tests, but they are expected to detail how they tested their code in their pull requests.




## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	No there isn't, but there are Javadocs available online and bundled with libGDX.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	Doesn't seem like it. There are guidelines that talk about formatting, code style, compatibility, and performance considerations in the [Contributing](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/hacking/Contributing.html) document.

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

	10 commits in the past week

2. When was the most recent commit? <br>

3. How many issues are currently open? <br>

	274 issues are currently open

4. How long do issues stay open? <br>

	Issues stay open for an avg. of 1.8 days.
	
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

5. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Discussion is decently active. But it depends on the kind of issue. Some open issues don't have any discussion, but some (both open/closed) issues have a decent amount of discussion.

6. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

	There is a "good first issue" tag, but it seems to be rarely used.

7. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

	64 issues were closed in the past 6 months

8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

	There is a CONTRIBUTORS and AUTHORS doc.

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

	According to GitHub's Insights tab, there have been 13 contributors to master (code contributions) in the past 6 months. However, this does not take into account other types of contributions such as issue reports or wiki contributions.

10. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

	There are 84 open pull requests.

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>

	Pull requests remain un-answered for an avg. of 1 day.
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

	There is active discussion on pull requests.

13. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

	75 pull requests opened within past 6 months

14. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

	Yesterday, 3/7/2020.

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

	There is a [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Contributing) document. It is quite easy to read and understand.
	
2. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

	There doesn't seem to be a CODE OF CONDUCT document.

3. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

	Yes, maintainers often respond with more questions trying to ascertain the root of the issues, and they try to work out how an issue may be solved.

4. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

	Yes.

5. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>

	Yes they do.

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. How involved was the process? <br>

	Not too involved, as the process is quite simple. 

2. How long did it take you? <br>

	Took me around 10 minutes.

3. Did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

	I had to install maven.

4. Were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>

	Yes.

5. Did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>

	For setting up, I just had to go to the download pages of the required/recommended IDEs.

6. Any other comments? <br>

	n/a



## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>

	I am primarily a Java programmer, and this project is primarily Java focused. The code isn't too difficult to understand, so I should be able to contribute some code. There is also a wiki that I can contribute to.

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>

	As someone who is very interested in using libGDX for a game of my own, I'm pretty interested in contributing to libGDX.
