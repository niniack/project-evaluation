## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
	The project has a GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1.



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	The primary programming language is JavaScript. 

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	You do not need to develop a virtual machine. It is pretty straight forward with this project, you just need to install node.js and grunt (task manager) and you can start developing on any IDE that supports JavaScript.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	The instructions are very straight forward and geared towards first time contributors. [Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js#get-started) you can find out how to download. [Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/master/contributor_docs#development-process) you can find out how to build and install. How to build and install was not information that was immediately accessible on the README, however you can find all the information you need on this in the contributing documents. The information is nicely organized with tangible, easy to follow steps. 


1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	For developing, yes you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). This information was clearly stated in the contributing documentation and the documents even linked to the sites so you could see how to install and download for your specific machine. 

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	I looked at the [creating_reading.js file](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/src/color/creating_reading.js). In comparison to the other open source projects I looked at I would say this project is very well commented. Before each major block of code there are comments documenting what it does in detail. Also since this project deals with design, there are comments defining different design details for those who might not be familiar. Before each function, there are comments detailing what it does, what parameters it takes in and what it returns. I would say, judging from this file, the code is documented very well making the code easy to read through and understand. 

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	According to openhub this project has 58.8k lines of code. 

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	[Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/master/test) you can find the tests for this project. According to the [contributing documents](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/master/test) you should write unit tests if you contribute a major new feature. 


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	There is very clear documentation in the code. Before each function there is a formal comment explaining what it does, what parameters it takes in and what is returned. The code also defines any terms a newbie might not understand. 

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	[Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/contributor_docs/webgl_mode_architecture.md) you can find information on the architecture. [Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/contributor_docs/design_principles.md) is a document on design principles but it is not super extensive. 

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>
	There have been 9 commits in the past week. 

1. When was the most recent commit? <br>

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	Issues stay open for typically .4 days (3 out of 5 of the most recent issues were closed within less than 1 day).

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>
	On every single recent issue open and closed (with the exception of ones recently opened) there are comments and active discussion. If there are no comments, which is rare then the issue is just assigned and merged. No issue from what I saw is left unanswered or unresolved. 

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>
	Yes there are labels tagged "level:advanced", "level:moderate", "level:beginner", and "level:unknown".

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>
	162 issues. 

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>
	[Here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/master/contributor_docs) you can find the contributing documents. It is pretty easy to read through, providing you with all steps necessary from installing to how to comment to how to contribute exactly to who to contact if you are having issues. The main README is short, but includes all the nexessary information for how to begin, and you can click through other links for more information when necessary. 

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>
	The code of conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you violate it you can potentially be excluded from the project. 

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>
	Maintainers are super helpful. Maintainer Lauren Lee McCarthy is especially helpful and active. I have noticed her responding to issues (no matter how small) everyday and making constructive comments to contributors. 

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>
	I have not noticed anyone being rude. I believe this project encourages first time contibutors because everyone is super inviting and encouraging. 

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>
	Yes maintainers do thank people for their contributions including both issues and pull requests. 

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>
	The process was very simple and straightforward. The only issue I had was when installing Grunt but I just did a quick google search and found an alernate command to install it. Other than that the process was seamless. 

1. how long it take you? <br>
	The process took about 5 minutes. 

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
	Yes I installed node and grunt. 

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
	Yes I was.

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
	I just needed to look up how to install Grunt because terminal kept returning "permissions denied". So I used this command **sudo npm install -g grunt-cli**. 

1. any other comments? <br>
	Process was super simple. 




## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	This would be a perfect project in my opinion. Not only is the community really responsive and helpful, but the process to install was super straightforward. The project has great documentation. If you are interested in what the project does I highly recommend contributing to this project. 

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	I personally wanted to contribute to a Swift project, but if I cannot find one I would be more than happy to contribute to this project. The project itself seems very interesting and it encourages first time contributors like myself. I would like to contribute.
