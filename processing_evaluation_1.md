## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
Processing is a programming language and development environment for those learning how to code with an emphasis on the visual arts. There are multiple versions that are based on different programming languages (e.g. p5.js is a version of Processing based on JavaScript), but the main (and original) one is based on Java.

1. Project website/homepage: https://processing.org/

1. Project repository: https://github.com/processing/processing



## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
They use GPL v2 for the parts of the project that they have developed themselves. Th e core library uses LGPL, but everything else uses GPL. One of their open issues is that their license information has become a mess.



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
The main language is Java at 95.7%.

1. What is the development environment? <br>
They have build instructions [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions). The developer needs to install Java 8 and Apache Ant before cloning the repository. They also include notes on troubleshooting this process and special notes for different platforms (Mac OSX, Windows, Linux, other).

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
To simply download and use Processing, the user just needs to go to their [Download page](https://processing.org/download/) and select which platform they are using. As stated in the previous question, the process for building the source is located in their wiki [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions). All of this information is linked in their README file.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database, graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
The project uses Apache Ant and the instructions are included on the wiki page for build instructions.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
The code is fairly easy to understand as there are a lot of comments and explanations in most of the files.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
OpenHub says the project has 115,125 lines of code so it is a fairly big project.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
There does not seem to be much information about testing in either the CONTRIBUTING document or the README.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
Yes, a lot of the files have explanations about the document as a whole at the top of each file and comments within the code explaining what the lines of code do.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
There is not one currently. Their [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document says they need more information in the document about things including "an explanation of how the code itself is designed".

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>
There have been zero commits this past week.

There are 514 open issues currently.

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
From five recently closed issues, the average time it took to close was 11 days.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>
Yes there does seem to be pretty active commenting (I wouldn't go as far as saying it's discussion). Most open issues have at least 1 comment on them and closed issues seem to have an average of 3-4 comments.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>
They don't have that many labels for level distinction, but there are issues with the label "help wanted" that are good for new contributors to work with.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>
109 issues were closed in the past six months.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>
It doesn't explicitly say, but it seems like Ben Fry is the person maintaining the project.

There have been four contributors in the past six months.

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>
There are 22 open pull requests.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	For the five most recent pull requests, they remained open for an average of 18 days.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>
  Not necessarily active or discussions, but there are comments. Sometimes there are active discussions between Ben Fry (the person maintaining the project).

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>
Ten pull requests were opened (created) within the past six months (4 are still open and 6 are closed).

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>
The last pull request that was merged was merged on January 18, 2020.

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>
Yes, they do have  CONTRIBUTING document and what is there is clear. However, the document is not thorough and they have a section saying that they would like to add more detail to it.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>
I could not find a code of conduct in the repository or the main site.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>
Yes, there does seem to be people responding to people's questions and issues. I'm not sure whether or not they are the maintainer(s), but they do seem helpful.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>
Yes, the do seem nice and professional.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>
Yes, whenever there is a merged pull request, I usually see a thank you from Ben Fry.


## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

I had to create an Oracle account to download JDK 8u202. After that, downloading it was pretty straightforward. Next I had to download Apache Ant. Since I'm on a Mac, I needed to use Homebrew to download it. I already had Homebrew downloaded, but it took a while to update. After that, Ant was installed. I then cloned the repository and tried to build it, but it failed. I still cannot figure out what went wrong.

1. how involved was the process? <br>
The first steps weren't too involved, but when I went to build, it failed. After that, I had to do some troubleshooting to figure out what went wrong.

1. how long it take you? <br>
It took me 20 mintues to get to the point where it failed.

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
I installed JDK 8u202 and Apache Ant.

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
I was not and am still working on figuring out what went wrong.

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
Yes I did because the build failed and the instructions did not include my case.

1. any other comments? <br>




## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	I'm leaning towards no because the repository looks pretty inactive. However, they do seem like they are looking for help and there are a lot of open issues.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
I would be interested in contributing to this project because I've been using it for my other class (Intro to Programming for Games in Tisch Open Arts). However, seeing how inactive the repository is gives me pause.
