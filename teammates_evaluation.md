## Summary

in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	Yes, I think it would be possible. However, it seems as though the contributors are not as active as they use to be. The project seems to be pretty slow. 

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	Yes, I would consider contributing to this project. However, since the project seems to have slowed down I am unsure if maintainers would be very responsive. If I were contributing to this project, I would focus on solving beginner issues and focu on working on documentation.
