## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	I thought at the beginning of the evaluation, but as I saw how active the movement of this project was, I came to the conclusion that it is too quick and would not make it easy for students in an educational environment.
	

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	I was, but not anymore. It seems a little unfeasable and does not look user friendly.
